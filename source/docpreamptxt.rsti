For easier creation, editing and maintenance, this documentation is written
using the |reStructuredText| syntax and processed using the |Sphinx| text
processor. The presentation and distribution in |HTML| or |PDF| formats are
only a result of processing with Sphinx from the underlying reStructuredText
sources.

Thus, the methodology of "Programmable Documentation" is applied here.
A GitLab/CI server performs the Sphinx processing. Its results are
considered to be official and can be accessed using the following links:
